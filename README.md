Mean Squared Error (MSE):
MSE measures the average squared difference between the actual values (true values) and the predicted values from the model. In other words, it calculates how close the predictions are to the actual values by taking the difference, squaring it (to eliminate negative values), and then averaging those squared differences. A lower MSE indicates better model performance.

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):
RMSE is the square root of the Mean Squared Error. It has the same unit as the original values, making it more interpretable than MSE. RMSE measures the average error made by the model in predicting the target variable. Like MSE, a lower RMSE value indicates better model performance.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
MAE measures the average absolute difference between the actual values and the predicted values from the model. It calculates how close the predictions are to the actual values by taking the absolute difference (ignoring the sign, positive or negative) and then averaging those differences. MAE is less sensitive to outliers than MSE and RMSE. A lower MAE value indicates better model performance.


MSE, RMSE, and MAE are all error metrics that help us assess the performance of a model.
They measure the difference between actual values and predicted values.
Lower values for these metrics indicate better model performance.
RMSE and MAE are more interpretable than MSE since they have the same unit as the original values.
MAE is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE and RMSE.
